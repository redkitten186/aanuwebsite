        The video shares 100 practical kitchen hacks used in restaurants to make cooking easier, faster, and tastier. Tips include washing produce in a vinegar solution to keep it fresh, peeling garlic by shaking cloves between bowls, bruising herbs to release flavor, and peeling ginger with a spoon. Other tricks cover efficiency, like using a potato masher for ground beef, freezing cheese before grating, shredding chicken with a mixer, and cracking eggs under water for easy peeling. Flavor and rescue hacks include seasoning from a height for even coverage, tossing veggies with salt, lemon, and olive oil, drying herbs to extend their life, and fixing overly salty soup with a potato.
